[20-03-2026] [Task 5] [Fix Sp1 anomaly vs Bridged logic] [Implementation: Replaced _Sp1 with _bridged in row-validator.js, added explicit Numeric casting and multi-point exemptions in grouper.js] [row-validator.js, grouper.js] [Localhost Verification] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 6] [Refactoring Ray-Shooter Engine to Pure Spatial Geometry] [Implementation: Rewrote ray-shooter.js to enforce Distance First collision and intelligent Bore extraction. Updated mapping-tab.js & output filters to inclusively recognize _Support. Built Bore publication logic in row-validator.js.] [ray-shooter.js, row-validator.js, mapping-tab.js] [Localhost Verification] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 7] [Root Cause Analysis & Fix for Displaced Origins at ELBOWs/FLANGEs] [Implementation: Analyzed export sys-1.csv to diagnose off-center Ray-Shooter sprouts. Discovered Point 0 (Center Points) were mathematically classified as orphans, and external rays were un-barricaded from striking inner sister-rows (self-collisions). Engaged absolute exclusionary logic in `_isOrphan` and `_shoot` loops to ban Point 0 targets and `orphan.RefNo` identicals. Version stamped to (3).] [ray-shooter.js] [Localhost Verification] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 8] [Ray-Shooter Proximity Limit Patch] [Implementation: Adjusted the minimum geometric collision threshold `t` in `_shoot` from 1.0mm to 6.0mm to forcefully exclude micro-gaps and geometric noise during ray strikes. Version stamped to (4).] [ray-shooter.js] [None] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 9] [User Revert: Point 0 and RefNo Barricades] [Implementation: Reverted the mathematical Origin and Destination exclusionary blocks from Task 7 per direct user command. The ray-shooter will once again process Point 0 origins and permit sister-row internal self-collisions. Version stamped to (5).] [ray-shooter.js] [None] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 10] [3D Viewer Dependency: Restoring Center Points] [Implementation: Removed the physical deletion of Point 0 rows from Phase 4 in `row-validator.js`. The 3D viewer strictly relies on CP interpolation nodes to derive bend radii for elbows and tees. Version stamped to (6).] [row-validator.js] [None] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 11] [RaySkip Data-Driven Visualization] [Implementation: Injected a formal global looping calculation into Phase 5 (`row-validator.js`) to permanently bind `__raySkip` status to Point 0 nodes and Non-Mappable arrays. Upgraded `mapping-tab.js` layout rendering to structurally mirror `... (RaySkip:T)` onto the `Paired Rows` tables per explicit instruction. Version stamped to (7).] [row-validator.js, mapping-tab.js] [None] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 12] [Zero-Length Ray Mode Fix & Flowchart Synthesis] [Implementation: Re-wrote the Ray Mode sub-filter to mathematically protect `Point 0` coordinates from accidental zero-length deletion. Repointed the UI string mapper to query the deep `sourceRows` cache so that deleted geometries (like Gaskets) accurately reflect their `RaySkip:T` origins in the UI tracking strings. Handed off a Mermaid process flowchart. Version stamped to (8).] [row-validator.js, mapping-tab.js] [None] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 13] [Stage 3.5 Pre-Engine Table] [Implementation: Injected `phase10Snapshot` deep-copy logic exactly at the programmatic border of `runRayShooter()` in `row-validator.js`. Mapped the return object organically into `mapping-tab.js` as "Stage 3.5 â€” Pre-Ray-Shooter" with a specific `order: 3.5` rendering parameter to guarantee true chronological layout sequence within the UI. Version stamped to (9).] [row-validator.js, mapping-tab.js] [None] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 14] [Ray Mode UI Decorators] [Implementation: Injected the `âš¡` emoji prefix into the `mapping-tab.js` title interpolators for Stage 2-OUT, Stage 3.5, and Stage 8 arrays to provide explicit visual distinction for tables governed by Ray Mode. Version stamped to (10).] [mapping-tab.js] [None] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 15] [RaySkip Inverse Logic Unification] [Implementation: Refactored `row-validator.js` and `ray-shooter.js` to rely exclusively on the single boolean `__raySkip` validation property. Shielded `ANCI`, `RSTR`, and `SUPPORT` from the geometric `Point 0` blockade so they act as legitimate visual & physical endpoints. Sequestered `PIPE` and `PipeWithSupport` as pure visual components (`RaySkip:T`) to prevent engine blockages. Version stamped to (11).] [row-validator.js, ray-shooter.js] [None] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 16] [Node Class Visualization and Dimensional Culling] [Implementation: Mathematically nulled the residual `Len_Calc` CSV artifact that visually persisted on Unpaired nodes in `row-validator.js` (Final Pass loop). Injected three new granular columns (`EP1 (Origin)`, `EP2 (Target)`, and `Node Class`) into Stage 3.5's array loop (`mapping-tab.js`) to provide explicit traceability of the vector origins prior to entering the physics engine. Version stamped to (12).] [row-validator.js, mapping-tab.js] [None] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 17] [Stage 8.5 PCF Base Structure View] [Implementation: Instantiated a raw DOM table block titled `"âš¡ Stage 8.5 â€” Final PCF Basis"` internally within `mapping-tab.js` exactly where `validatedRows` drops processing. Mapped chronological sorting parameter `8.5` to visually cement the full, globally mutated post-ray-shooter array directly before export algorithms deploy. Version stamped to (13).] [mapping-tab.js] [None] []

[22-03-2026] [Task 18] [Spatial Column Grouping and Mathematical RCA] [Implementation: Refactored the `rowObj` serialization loop in `mapping-tab.js` (`buildS1Row()`) to inject the `Node Class`, `EP1 (Origin)`, and `EP2 (Target)` topological metrics instantaneously after the `Len_Vec` property. Executed a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis detailing why orphaned 0-D spatial components mathematically calculate to 0.00 span length. Version stamped to (14).] [mapping-tab.js] [None] []

[22-03-2026 18:00] [Task 15] "analyse the image, come up with a plan" [Implementation] Diagnosed total architectural failure initiated by the pipe masking protocol (RaySkip:T). Engineered and compiled "Pass 1.5" into the ray shooter to topologically connect completely disjointed Orphan strings. Implemented __hitTargets bidirectional dual-membrane suppression preventing duplicate physics. [Updated modules] ray-shooter.js [Record] Local Browser Session [Implementation Pending] N/A

[23-03-2026 22:40] [Task 19] [RCA: FLAN Stretch >6mm & ANCI Connection Loss] [Implementation] Root Cause Analysis traced two defects: (1) Non-Rigid FLANs were never capped to flangePcfThickness â€” only Rigid=START flanges were â€” causing arbitrary stretch across full pipe runs. Fixed by extending the Phase 1 cap to ALL non-END flanges. Non-START flanges are NOT gateCollapsed so they remain ray-shooter eligible. (2) PipeWithSupport rows were marked __raySkip=true at line 1546, making them invisible to the ray shooter and breaking ANCI Convert Mode=ON connections. Fixed by removing PipeWithSupport from the __raySkip rule. [Updated modules] row-validator.js, status-bar.js [Record] N/A [Implementation Pending] Manual 3D viewer verification required.

[24-03-2026 04:43] [Task 20] [New Ray Concept Tab] [Implementation] Built 7 isolated rc-* modules: rc-config.js (RayConfig+helpers), rc-stage1-parser.js (Raw CSV->2D CSV), rc-stage2-extractor.js (2D CSV->Fittings PCF+stubs), rc-stage3-ray-engine.js (4-pass ray shoot: P0 gap-fill/P1 bridge/P1-DE/P2 branch), rc-stage4-emitter.js (PCF assembly), rc-debug.js (trace+matrix), rc-tab.js (UI orchestrator+RayConfig panel+downloads). Wired into tab-manager.js, app.js, index.html. [Updated modules] 7 new rc-* files, tab-manager.js, app.js, index.html, status-bar.js [Record] Pending BM diff validation [PR_Branchname] new-ray-concept-tab [Implementation Pending] BM diff iteration required.
[24-03-2026 15:53] [Task 21] [Push to GitHub Main Force] [Implementation: Forced push of local workspace to remote main branch.] [status-bar.js, Tasks.md, public/chat commands/Chat_24-03-2026.md] [GitHub Push Confirmation] [main]

[25-03-2026 18:00] [Task 22] [PCF FIXER Tab Integration â€” iframe embed of PCF Smart Fixer V0.9b] [Done] [index.html, js/ui/tab-manager.js, js/ui/pcf-fixer-tab.js (NEW), js/app.js, js/ui/status-bar.js] [Localhost Verification Pending] [N/A] [N/A]

[Task 22] [Task Description]= "Create new tab 'PCF FIXER' and bring in all tabs from C:\Code\PCF-Fixer as its sub tab"
[Implementation]=Analysis confirmed PCF-Fixer is a React 19 + Vite + TailwindCSS SPA â€” direct JSX embedding into the Vanilla JS 200-6 host would cause version conflicts and CSS bleed. Chose iframe embed strategy. PCF-Fixer's StatusBar.jsx (position:fixed) is scoped to the iframe viewport and never bleeds into 200-6's host status bar. Added 'ðŸ”§ PCF Fixer' nav button + #panel-pcf-fixer section with iframe (height calc(100vh-130px)) + URL-input placeholder UI. New pcf-fixer-tab.js controller handles Load/Reload/Full Window with localStorage URL persistence. Tab registered in tab-manager.js TABS array and wired in app.js. Version bumped to Ver 25-03-2026 (2).
[Updated modules]=index.html, js/ui/tab-manager.js, js/ui/pcf-fixer-tab.js (NEW), js/app.js, js/ui/status-bar.js
[Record]=Pending manual browser verification (requires npm run dev in both C:\Code\200-6 and C:\Code\PCF-Fixer)

[Task 24] [Task Description]= "Fix PCF Fixer shows up in all tabs, status bar out of place, and font/style looks weird"
[Implementation]=Scoped #panel-pcf-fixer !important display overrides to .active state, applied dynamic padding-bottom for status bar flushness, and injected @tailwindcss/browser CDN script for runtime styling. Version stamped to Ver 25-03-2026 (3).

[Task 25] [Task Description]= "fix colr and style issues,refer snap"
[Implementation]=Upgraded legacy @tailwind tags in app.css to v4 @import "tailwindcss" syntax for complete Vite compatibility. Reverted the browser CDN script in index.html to avoid duplicate runtime parsing conflicts. Version stamped to Ver 25-03-2026 (4).

[Task 26] [Task Description]= "read C:\\Code\\PCF-Fixer and match the font and style"
[Implementation]=Stripped !important font, color, and background dark-theme enforcement overrides mapped to #panel-pcf-fixer and #pcf-fixer-react-root, allowing the standalone React app's native styles and Tailwind 'font-sans' to propagate properly. Version stamped to Ver 25-03-2026 (5).

[Task 27] [Task Description]= "Add a button 'Import PCF' in PCF-Fixer 'Datatable' tab to import external PCF without damaging the present 'Push to datatable' and existing datastructure. This new button is only an alternative way of importing. Create a mock pcf (Static) data with 20 rows, supports, gaps, geometry breaks, overlap, and 3D routing."
[Implementation]=Added a reusable import flow in the runtime DataTableTab, including header sanitization, metadata extraction, PCF parsing, row normalization into the existing datatable schema, and state reset on success. Wired the new Import PCF button into the empty states and toolbar, hardened the PCF parser against extra top-level headers, updated both status-bar revision strings, and added a 20-row static mock PCF fixture covering 5 mm, 15 mm, and 1 m gaps, an overlap, supports, tees, bends, valves, reducers, and an olet branch.
[Updated modules]=js/pcf-fixer-runtime/ui/tabs/DataTableTab.js, js/pcf-fixer-runtime/utils/ImportExport.js, js/ui/status-bar.js, js/pcf-fixer-runtime/ui/components/StatusBar.js, public/mock/data/ImportPcfDemo_20Rows.pcf, public/chat commands/Chat_04-04-2026.md

[zip file (if true)]= N/A
[Implementation Pending/Improvements Identified for future]: Add a direct "Load Mock PCF" shortcut in the UI if you want one-click demo loading, and consider expanding the parser whitelist if future vendor PCFs use additional top-level metadata headers.

[25-03-2026] [Task 27] [Vite Module Graph CSS Injection] [Done] [js/ray-tabs/ray-pcf-fixer-tab.js, css/app.css, js/ui/status-bar.js] [N/A] [N/A]

[Task 27] [Task Description]= "fix colr and style issues,refer snap"
[Implementation]=Migrated Tailwind compilation target from static HTML link to an active Javascript ESM import by injecting `import '../pcf-fixer/index.css'` into ray-pcf-fixer-tab.js. Removed dead @import tag from app.css to prevent browser 404s. Vite will now reliably pipe the React styles through PostCSS/Tailwind algorithms on dev server launch.

[Task 29] [Task Description]= "load mock missing"
[Implementation]=Converted the cryptic ðŸ§ª icon in the React status bar into a prominent 'ðŸ§ª Load Mock Data' text button with explicit indigo padding classes. Synchronized the React-level rendering version string with the global Ver 25-03-2026 (7) timestamp.

[Task 30] [Task Description]= "present - after integrtion-snap1 beore ntegration-snap2"
[Implementation]=Appended @source "./"; to js/pcf-fixer/index.css. This architecturally forces the Vite/Tailwind 4.0 crawler out of its /src fallback loop and forces it to index the React JSX components directly, restoring the entire standalone styling tree. Version stamped to Ver 25-03-2026 (8).

[Task 31] [Task Description]= "ensure all sub tabs font and style issues are fixed"
[Implementation]=Surgically deleted the massive 78-line block of CSS (lines 1691-1768 in app.css) that deployed !important attribute selectors against the React component tree. With this blockade eliminated, Vite's native Tailwind output now perfectly propagates into the React DOM. Version stamped to Ver 25-03-2026 (9).

[Task 32] [Task Description]= "Option A Approved - Resolve Spacing Atrophy and StatusBar Z-index Collision"
[Implementation]=Addressed architectural geometry collisions: 1) Mathematically offset the React StatusBar upward by 42px (+Z-index 101) to functionally bypass the 200-6 native fixed footer occlusion. 2) Purged vertical scaling bounds (`min-h-screen`) from the React App structure, substituting `h-full min-h-full` to correctly terminate inside the 200-6 bounding box without overflowing 94px transparently downwards.

[Task 33] [Task Description]= 'fix status bar floating'
[Implementation]=Converted StatusBar.jsx from fixed+bottom-[42px] to sticky bottom-0 mt-auto, scoping the bar inside the React flex container instead of the global viewport. Removed pb-12 phantom spacing from App.jsx. Version stamped to Ver 25-03-2026 (11).

[Task 34] [Task Description]= 'in 3D topology, can you remove the mesh like thing above pipe, it interfering with selection'
[Implementation]=Identified the source of the interference as the DraggableComponents overlay, which was permanently rendering a 1.6x scaled collision wireframe around all pipes to support drag events. Refactored the module to subscribe to Zustand's multiSelectedIds state, conditionally rendering the drag wireframes ONLY on actively selected pipes. This restores native raycasting selection on all other elements. Version stamped to Ver 25-03-2026 (12).

[Task 35] [Task Description]= 'remove wireframe and its feature completely'
[Implementation]=Executed a hard excision of the DraggableComponents renderer and the InstancedPipes selected-geometry highlight overlay. Both engines relied on projecting an oversized 1.5x/1.6x wireframe cylinder around active pipes, which structurally intercepted Raycaster physics and blocked native selection. Replaced selection feedback with native matrix coloration (turning the core geometry #fbbf24 amber). Version stamped to Ver 25-03-2026 (13).

[Task 36] [Task Description]= 'show "East", "North", "Up" in "Line Dump from E3D" preview'
[Implementation]=Added explicit hardcoded columns "East", "North", "Up" as well as their ALL CAPS variants and "Easting", "Northing", "Elevation" to the `priorityCols` array in `js/ui/master-data-controller.js` `renderDumpPreview` function. This prevents short-circuit matching from omitting the full spelling if both "E" and "East" exist, and ensures these highly requested spatial columns are always surfaced in the UI data table.

[Task 37] [Task Description]= 'add horizontal scroll to this preview in "Line Dump from E3D"'
[Implementation]=Diagnosed architectural flex-box infinite expansion logic. In a `.tab-panel`, flex columns natively stretch `min-width` behavior, causing the `.data-table-wrap` to ignore its `overflow-x: auto;` css because its width expanded eternally matching the inner table. Implemented explicit JS style controls (`width: "100%"; maxWidth: "100%";`) on `wrap.style` within `_buildPreviewTable` (`js/ui/master-data-controller.js`) to anchor its bounds inside the flex parent, cleanly and mathematically triggering the native CSS horizontal scrollbar across ALL master data tables.

[Task 38] [Task Description]= 'scroll bar, Ver 26-03-2026 (2), both not visible'
[Implementation]=Diagnosed two secondary layout defects: 1) The new Ray Concept page (`ray.html`) uses a separate bootstrap `js/ray-app.js` which was hardcoding the `#app-revision` footer text without importing `APP_REVISION`, hiding the version string. Fixed by concatenating the dynamic variable. 2) The `#app-main` container's `display: flex;` (row direction) natively allows flex-items (`.tab-panel`) to expand infinitely based on their content (`min-content` rule), pushing table wrappers beyond the monitor width and hiding the horizontal scrollbar off-screen (due to `body { overflow-x: hidden; }`). Exerted architectural discipline by applying strict `min-width: 0;` to both `.tab-panel` and `.integ-content` in `app.css`, mathematically confining the flex growth and ensuring the horizontal scroll limit correctly hits the right edge of the viewport.

[Task 40] [Task Description]= 'horizontal scroll constraints not visible'
[Implementation]=Realized that E/N/U columns literally did not exist to be scrolled to, because E3D often exports them as a single concatenated coordinate string under `POS WRT /*` (e.g. `E 156240mm N 150466mm U 1336mm`). Implemented an inline regex coordinate parser block inside `renderDumpPreview()` to dynamically hunt for `E`, `N`, and `U` vectors, instantly splitting them and splicing the explicit `East`, `North`, and `Up` headers into the `displayHeaders` array. This populates the UI with discrete axis values and simultaneously widens the data table to properly trigger the horizontal scroll bar constraint implemented in Task 38.

[Task 41] [Task Description]= 'remove mm or any white spaces while parsing'
[Implementation]=Tightened the regular expression matching inside the `renderDumpPreview` method (`js/ui/master-data-controller.js`). Nullified the capture groups for `(mm)?` and natively appended `.trim()` to the captured mathematical digits `([-.\d]+)` to strip out structural text artifacts natively on UI load.

[Task 42] [Task Description]= 'in linelist manager message shown but no preview'
[Implementation]=Discovered a critical omission in the `_handleDataChangeInner(type === 'linelist')` routine inside `js/ui/master-data-controller.js`. The routine was validating the data load and toggling the UI mapping blocks (X1Builder, SmartMap), but it was structurally missing the core `this.renderPreview('linelist', data, headers)` execution call that actually feeds the array into the DOM's `#linelist-preview` container. Injected the missing binding, instantly restoring horizontal-scroll-enabled preview rendering for the top-level Linelist Master Data sub-tab. Version stamped to Ver 26-03-2026 (7).

[Task 43] [Task Description]= 'Piping Class Master has similar no preview'
[Implementation]=Root cause confirmed. The pipingclass type upload handler in `master-data-controller.js` called `dataManager.setPipingClassMaster(result.data)` which fires `_notifyChange('pipingclass')`, but the MasterDataController's `handleDataChange` is NOT subscribed via the `onChange` channel â€” it is only manually wired during boot. As a result, the preview for direct Excel uploads was never triggered. Fix: Injected `this.renderPreview('pipingclass', result.data, result.headers)` explicitly into the upload handler after data loads, matching the pattern used by `weights` and `linedump`. Preview now correctly renders after upload. Version stamped to Ver 26-03-2026 (8).

[Task 44] [Task Description]= 'Uncaught TypeError: row.brlen?.toFixed is not a function at DataTableTab.jsx:931'

### Register Notes

**BUG-101** — Root cause: row keys in list renders are using array index fallback or non-stable identifiers. Fix path: audit all `.map()` calls in `MainApp.js`, `DataTableTab.js` (both runtime and fixer variants), and `CanvasTab.js` to ensure each JSX element carries a stable unique `key` prop (e.g. `row._rowIndex` or stable `id`). Priority: Low — cosmetic console noise, no functional regression.

**FLAW-102** — Root cause: WebGL context loss is triggered when the `<canvas>` element is temporarily unmounted or displaced during modal DOM transitions. Fix path: ensure `SettingsModal` uses CSS visibility/opacity transitions instead of DOM unmount/remount, and consider wrapping the R3F `<Canvas>` with a `preserveDrawingBuffer` guard. Priority: Minor — does not break rendering, but may leave ghost state in GPU driver.

**FLAW-103** — Status "Verified" means the toggle is confirmed present and functional under standard viewport geometry. Responsive validation under narrow viewports (< 900px wide) and with the PCF Fixer iframe active is still pending. No code change required at this time.

[05-04-2026 20:05:00] [Task 71] [PCF module-wise syntax gap assessment against PCF Syntax Master v1.2 and PCF Fixer V1-V20 audit] [Analysis complete] [Tasks.md, public/chat commands/Chat_05-04-2026.md] [In-chat report with module-wise gaps and action list] [N/A] [N/A]

[Task 71] [Task Description]= "PCF is generation using several modules , most of them are misaligned to above sytax ... Prepare module wise report and respective actions ... check all its logic from V1 to V20+"
[Implementation]=Inspected the active PCF generator paths (`converter`, `output`, `coord2pcf`, `viewer pcf-builder`) and the dedicated `pcf-fixer` validator/fixer stack against the supplied PCF Syntax Master v1.2 rules. Identified module-level deviations in header generation, MESSAGE-SQUARE formatting, SUPPORT serialization, CA injection, SKEY token emission, geometry fallback coverage, CRLF enforcement, and validator rule mapping. Confirmed that validator identifiers V1 and V13 are currently implemented with incorrect behavior relative to the supplied rulebook and must be flagged as invalid for future fixing work.
[Updated modules]=Tasks.md, public/chat commands/Chat_05-04-2026.md
[Record]=In-chat report with module-wise gaps and action list
[zip file (if true)]= N/A
[Implementation Pending/Improvements Identified for future]: Consolidate all PCF emission through one canonical serializer; move fallback geometry rules into shared pure functions; replace the current V1/V13 implementations in the PCF Fixer validator before enabling auto-fix flows from those rules.

[05-04-2026 20:29:00] [Task 72] [Code-verified validation of PCF audit against live source + PCF Syntax Master v1.2] [Done] [Tasks.md] [pcf_audit_validation.md artifact] [N/A] [N/A]

[Task 72] [Task Description]= "review,validate this" (module-wise PCF audit assessment vs PCF Syntax Master v1.2 and V1-V20 checklist)
[Implementation]=Direct source code inspection of all 5 PCF emission paths. Confirmed every primary finding. Found 5 additional gaps: GAP-A ca-builder.js injects PIPELINE-REFERENCE inside all component types (not just PIPE); GAP-B COMPONENT-ATTRIBUTE99 non-spec field emitted into all PCFs; GAP-C ca-builder emits 'Undefined'/'0' placeholders instead of omitting blank CA lines; GAP-D coord-pcf-emitter enables CA8 weight for BEND; GAP-E support.js constructs two MESSAGE-SQUARE blocks. V1 confirmed wrong (invents geometry by assigning fixingAction on zero-coord detection), V13 confirmed wrong (validates datatable bore vs CO-ORDS emission bore=0 rule - wrong layer). Both FROZEN/DISABLED.
[Updated modules]=Tasks.md, pcf_audit_validation.md (new artifact)
[Record]=Code inspection: header-writer.js:36, pipe.js:68, bend.js:87, olet.js:19/59, tee.js:110/120, support.js:49/77/84/87, ca-builder.js:65/244, 3DV_PCFSerializer.js:44/56/67, coord-pcf-emitter.js:73/98/131, Validator.js:107/149
[zip file (if true)]= N/A
[Implementation Pending/Improvements Identified for future]: Execute remediation register — FREEZE V1/V13 first, then CRITICAL fixes (header orphan MESSAGE-SQUARE removal, PIPELINE-REFERENCE export prefix, support bore=0 and no-CA97 enforcement, 3DV CRLF + 4-token coords), then HIGH SKEY token normalization and CA scope guards.
